<p>Good morning, little boy; how do you do? Bring your little stool and sit
down by me, for I have a great deal to tell you.</p>

<p>I hope you have been a good boy, and read all the pretty words I wrote

tired, and you want some more new lessons. Come, then, sit down. Now you

there is a hole in the ice. Come in. It is four o'clock. It is dark.
Light the candles: and, Ralph! get some wood from the wood-house, and
get some coals, and make a very good fire.</p>

<p>Now get the large picture-book, and let us look at the pretty pictures,
and I will tell you stories about them.</p>

<p>When spring comes again there will be green leaves and flowers, daisies

warm weather. Come again, spring!</p>

<p>What a noise the rooks make! Caw! caw! caw! and how busy they are! They
are going to build their nests. There is a man ploughing the field. In a

autumn. In some places oxen draw the plough instead of horses.</p>

<p>We will drink tea out of doors. Bring the tea-things. It is very

too? Yes, everything. Now we must make hay. Where is your fork and rake?
Spread the hay. Now make it up into cocks. Now tumble on the haycock.
There, cover Harry up with hay. How sweet the hay smells! Oh, it is very
hot. No matter; you should<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_191" id="Page_191">[Pg 191]</a></span> make hay while the sun shines. You must work
well. See! all the lads and lasses are at work. They must have some

looks! We can look at him now; he is not so bright as he was at

the plants will die. Where is the watering-pot? Let us go under the
trees. It is shady there: it is not so hot. Come into the arbour. There

sickle and cut down the corn; it is ripe. Now it must be tied up in
sheaves. Now put a great many sheaves together, and make a shock.</p>

soon. Now it begins. What large drops! The ducks are very glad, but the
little birds are not glad; they go and shelter themselves under the
trees. Now the rain is over. It was only a shower. Now the flowers smell
sweet, and the sun shines, and the little birds sing again, and it is
not so hot as it was before it rained.</p>

<p>Hark! somebody is letting off a gun! They are shooting the poor birds.
Here is a bird dropped down just at your feet. It is all bloody. Poor
thing! how it flutters! Its wing is broken. It cannot fly any further.
It is going to die. What bird is it? It is a partridge. Are you not
sorry, Harry? It was alive a little while ago.</p>

<p>Bring the ladder, and set it against the tree. Now bring a basket. We
must gather apples. No, you cannot go up the ladder; you must have a
little basket, and pick up apples under the tree. Shake the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_197" id="Page_197">[Pg 197]</a></span> tree. Down
they come. How many have you got? We will have an apple-dumpling. Come,
you must help to carry the apples into the apple-chamber. Apples make
cyder. You shall have some baked pears and bread for supper, and some
cyder. Are these apples? No, they are quinces; they will make marmalade.
Do not be in such haste, little boy; you shall have some cyder directly.
You must not drink much.</p>

<p>Will you have any nuts? Fetch the nut-crackers. Peel this walnut. I will
make you a little boat of the walnut-shell, and you can swim it in a

<p>There was a little boy; he was not a big boy, for if he had been a big
boy I suppose he would have been wiser; but this was a little boy, not
higher than the table, and his papa and mamma sent him to school. It was
a very pleasant morning; the sun shone, and the birds sung on the trees.
Now this little boy did not much love his book, for he was but a silly
little boy, as I told you; and he had a great mind to play instead of
going to school. And he saw a<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_205" id="Page_205">[Pg 205]</a></span>
bee flying about, first upon one flower, and then upon another; so he
said, &ldquo;Pretty bee! will you come and play with me?&rdquo; But the bee said,
&ldquo;No, I must not be idle; I must go and gather honey.&rdquo; Then the little
boy met a dog, and he said, &ldquo;Dog! will you play with me?&rdquo; But the dog
said, &ldquo;No, I must not be idle; I am going to catch a hare for my
master's dinner: I<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_206" id="Page_206">[Pg 206]</a></span> must make haste and catch it.&rdquo; Then the little boy
went by a hay-rick, and he saw a bird pulling some hay out of the
hay-rick, and he said, &ldquo;Bird! will you come and play with me?&rdquo; But the
bird said, &ldquo;No, I must not be idle; I must get some hay to build my nest
with, and some moss, and some wool.&rdquo; So the bird flew away. Then the
little boy saw a horse, and he said, &ldquo;Horse! will you play with me?&rdquo; But
the horse said, &ldquo;No, I must not be idle; I must go and plough, or else
there will be no corn to make bread of.&rdquo; Then the little boy thought
with himself, &ldquo;What! is nobody idle? then little boys must not be idle
neither.&rdquo; So he made haste, and went to school, and learned his lesson
very well, and the master said he was a good boy.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_207" id="Page_207">[Pg 207]</a></span></p>

</div>

<p><br />ARLY one morning during last summer, Harry and I put on our hats, and
taking some cake in our pockets for lunch set out for a good long walk.
First we went through the Home Meadow, where the tall elm-trees are, and
then through the gate at the bottom of the valley into the corn-fields.
The sun was shining bright and clear, and a lark was singing high up in
the blue sky<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_212" id="Page_212">[Pg 212]</a></span> almost beyond our sight. Harry and I stood still to watch
its descent, and after many minutes we saw it alight near a tuft of
grass by the hedge-side. We walked a little nearer, and then we found
that there was another bird there with some young ones; so we thought
that this lark had been singing its long, sweet song in the air<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_213" id="Page_213">[Pg 213]</a></span> to
cheer its mate, who was feeding their little ones in the nest.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 400px;">
<img src="images/illus-0213-1-small.jpg" width="400" height="268" alt="" title="lark" />
</div>

<p>We then walked on, and soon came to the skirts of the wood, through
which runs a little stream. We thought there must be some one in the
wood, for we heard a smart tapping sound, like the noise of a little
hammer. I climbed on the top of a hedge-bank, and, after a little while,
found that the noise came from over our heads. On the trunk of a tree
were two wood-peckers pecking with their long beaks at the bark of a
fir-tree, in which they find a number of little insects, which serve
them for their food. I lifted Harry up to see them at their work, but he
did not frighten them, and at some long way off we could still hear them
tapping away.</p>


<div class="figcenter" style="width: 294px;">
<img src="images/illus-0215-1-small.jpg" width="294" height="400" alt="" title="woodpecker" />
</div>

<p>Just at the corner of the wood, as we were turning round by the side of
the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_214" id="Page_214">[Pg 214]</a></span> fence, we saw two hares and a rabbit feeding among the clover; one
of them pricked<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_215" id="Page_215">[Pg 215]</a></span> up his ears and looked at us for a moment, and then all
of them ran away across the field much faster than Harry, who tried all
he could to catch them.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 400px;">
<img src="images/illus-0216-1-small.jpg" width="400" height="267" alt="" title="rabbits" />
</div>

<p>We had not walked much further when we heard a great chattering, and
when we came to a young beech-tree close by the stile, we soon found the
cause of the noise.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_216" id="Page_216">[Pg 216]</a></span> About two dozen or more of a little bird called the
titmouse had all perched on one tree, where they were pecking, and
fighting,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_217" id="Page_217">[Pg 217]</a></span> and love-making, and noise-making, all at the same time.
Except the noise made by sparrows when they go to bed on a summer's
evening, I never heard the like.</p>


<div class="figcenter" style="width: 400px;">
<img src="images/illus-0217-1-small.jpg" width="400" height="391" alt="" title="beech-tree" />
</div>

<p>While I was amusing myself by watching the titmice, Harry, who had
rambled on a little way, came running back to ask me what the funny
thing could be that he had<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_218" id="Page_218">[Pg 218]</a></span> found. It was a mole that had been caught in
a trap, and was dangling in the air with a swarm of bees around. I told
Harry that the moles are blind, or nearly so, and that they live under
the ground, and do great good to the farmers by eating the slugs and
other things that destroy the corn; but that they turn up such great
mounds of earth when making their tunnels, that the farmers are often
glad to get rid of them, and therefore set traps to kill them.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 400px;">
<img src="images/illus-0218-1-small.jpg" width="400" height="241" alt="" title="dangling in the air" />
</div>

<p>In the next field we came to, the young wheat had grown up higher than
my knees, and Harry was greatly pleased at running down the furrows and
making the blades of corn bend before him. Presently he stopped and
peeped through an opening, whence he discovered a whole covey of
partridges, the two old birds and seven young ones; they all rose with a
whirring noise,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_219" id="Page_219">[Pg 219]</a></span> and flew into the field we had just left.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 400px;">
<img src="images/illus-0220-1-small.jpg" width="400" height="262" alt="" title="partridges" />
</div>

<p>Soon after the partridges had flown away, Harry was delighted to hear
the well-known voice of the cuckoo; it sounded so near us that we both
started at the first voice, and we soon found out where the cuckoo was.
Like a lazy tyrant, instead of making a house for himself, the cuckoo<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_220" id="Page_220">[Pg 220]</a></span>
takes the first little bird's nest he can find, and turns the poor
occupant away. When we reached the tree where the cuckoo was, we saw it
sitting on a small nest throwing out the eggs of a poor little bird, who
was screaming in anger at the intruder.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 400px;">
<img src="images/illus-0221-1-small.jpg" width="400" height="248" alt="" title="cuckoo" />
</div>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 238px;">
<img src="images/illus-0222-1-small.jpg" width="238" height="400" alt="" title="squirrel" />
</div>

<p>When I told Harry what the cuckoo had been doing, he wanted to throw a
stone at it, but I told him that this cuckoo<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_221" id="Page_221">[Pg 221]</a></span> was only doing what all
other cuckoos did, and that the poor little bird would soon build itself
another nest. As we walked on, still by the side of the wood, Harry saw
something jumping about in the boughs of a tree; and presently another
followed it: they were two squirrels, with their long bushy tails curled
over their backs, and their ears pricked up to hear the slightest noise.
As soon as they saw Harry looking at them they both leaped away, and we
lost them in the branches of a large<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_222" id="Page_222">[Pg 222]</a></span> oak. To look after the squirrels
we had climbed over the hedge, so we were walking a little way in the
wood. Presently I heard the call of a pheasant; and as we walked
further, we came to some brush-wood, under which were two old birds and<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_223" id="Page_223">[Pg 223]</a></span>
their young ones. They all flew away at our approach; but the old
cock-pheasant left two of his tail-feathers in the brush-wood, which
Harry soon picked up to decorate his hat with.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 400px;">
<img src="images/illus-0223-1-small.jpg" width="400" height="334" alt="" title="pheasants" />
</div>

<p>The next bird that caught our notice was a fly-catcher. It was sitting
on a bramble catching bees and flies, and so<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_224" id="Page_224">[Pg 224]</a></span> intently was it watching
for them, that it did not even notice our presence, till Harry tried to
put his hand on it, but then away it flew with a fine chattering.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 366px;">
<img src="images/illus-0224-1-small.jpg" width="366" height="400" alt="" title="flycatcher" />
</div>

<p>We now left the wood, and taking the foot-path to the left, went along
till we came to the road. Just by the stile sat a girl, who had been
gathering dried sticks in the wood, where her father was cutting down
trees. She had tied up the sticks into a bundle, and was sitting on them
to rest herself, because they were so heavy. She asked me to help her to
put them on her head; this I did, and then she thanked me, and trudged
on, singing as merrily as a lark in the sky.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 309px;">
<img src="images/illus-0226-1-small.jpg" width="309" height="400" alt="" title="sat a girl" />
</div>

<p>Now we came to a bridge over a wide river. I mounted Harry astride the
parapet, and there we stopped for some minutes to look at the boats as
they passed under<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_225" id="Page_225">[Pg 225]</a></span> us, and to watch two swans which were sailing up the
river with their great wings<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_226" id="Page_226">[Pg 226]</a></span> spread out for sails, and their necks so
proudly bent that they looked like the king and queen of the river.
Harry would have stayed for hours to look at them, but we could not stop
long.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 400px;">
<img src="images/illus-0227-1-small.jpg" width="400" height="302" alt="" title="swans" />
</div>

<p>We next turned down the pathway by the river-side, and soon we came to
the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_227" id="Page_227">[Pg 227]</a></span> wide marshes, which are only two miles off the sea. There we were
standing under a willow, watching for the fish which were swimming down
the river in little shoals, when we heard a splash on the opposite bank;
it was an otter that had dived into the river, and caught a fish, with
which we saw it climb on to the bank again. Men<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_228" id="Page_228">[Pg 228]</a></span> used to hunt the otter
with dogs and spears; and sometimes otters have been trained to catch
fish and bring them to land, but we do not often find them in England.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 400px;">
<img src="images/illus-0228-1-small.jpg" width="400" height="274" alt="" title="otters" />
</div>

<p>As we walked on by the river-side, we noticed a hawk flying swiftly over
us; afterwards we saw him balance himself on his wings, and keep for
many minutes in exactly the same place. Presently, with a loud scream,
he darted down into some rushes a little way before us, and then we
heard a most furious quacking, as if there were fifty ducks there. We
ran on and saw a drake flying at the hawk and pecking at its wings, and
the duck, quacking in the utmost alarm, tried to get all her little
ducklings under her wings; but, alas! one little truant ran into the
weeds, and the hawk caught it in his claws, and, in spite of all the
efforts of the poor drake, flew away with it.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_229" id="Page_229">[Pg 229]</a></span></p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 400px;">
<img src="images/illus-0230-1-small.jpg" width="400" height="359" alt="" title="hawks" />
</div>

<p>Harry was greatly excited at this scene, and cried to see the hawk carry
away the poor little duck; but he soon laughed again, for as he watched
the robber in his flight through the air, he saw a number of little
birds fly after him,&mdash;sparrows, swallows,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_230" id="Page_230">[Pg 230]</a></span> finches, all chirping at him
and mocking him; then a tribe of bigger birds, blackbirds, magpies,
rooks, and jays, flew after him also; and as the hawk could not fly fast
with the duckling in his claws, they soon overtook him, and we saw them
peck at his wings and his tail, and pull his feathers<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_231" id="Page_231">[Pg 231]</a></span> out; and they all
screamed and chattered at him till at last the hawk let the poor
duckling down into the marsh, and then, rising much higher than the
other birds, flew away so quickly that he was out of sight in a minute.
Harry clapped his hands with delight to see the hawk thus treated, and
said that he was rightly served.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 400px;">
<img src="images/illus-0231-1-small.jpg" width="400" height="299" alt="" title="bigger birds" />
</div>

<p>Now we walked on again by the river<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_232" id="Page_232">[Pg 232]</a></span>-side. The swallows skimmed along
the surface of the water, and caught the insects that hovered over it,
and now and then a sea-gull came with its great wings, and diving into
the river, bore away a poor fish in its beak to swallow at its leisure.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 400px;">
<img src="images/illus-0232-1-small.jpg" width="400" height="226" alt="" title="sea-gull" />
</div>

<p>Then we came close to a solemn-looking<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_233" id="Page_233">[Pg 233]</a></span> heron, who stood so still that
we could hardly tell if he were alive, till we saw him suddenly dive his
head in a pool of water and pull out a frog, which he swallowed at one
mouthful; and then he stood as still and solemn as ever. He flew away
when we walked near him, flapping his immense wings slowly, and giving a
mournful cry.</p>

<p>Then we turned away from the river, and took a path across the meadows,
where Harry ran about and gathered cowslips and buttercups until he was
quite tired; therefore it happened very luckily that just as we reached
the gate into the high-road, who should we see but Uncle George driving
past in his gig! He stopped his horse when he saw us, and both Harry and
I were very glad to have a nice ride home with him.</p>


<div class="figcenter" style="width: 400px;">
<img src="images/illus-0233-1-small.jpg" width="400" height="326" alt="" title="stork" />
</div>

<p>In the evening Harry and I went for a<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_234" id="Page_234">[Pg 234]</a></span> stroll in the fields near home,
and presently we came to one where the sheep were feeding. The shepherd
was just calling them home to be put in the fold, and we were very much
amused to see the antics of some of the young lambs that would skip
about instead of going to bed with their mothers. This put me in mind to
tell Harry Mrs. Barbauld's story about</p>

<h3>THE SILLY LITTLE LAMB.</h3>

<p>There was once a shepherd, who had a great many sheep and lambs. He took
a great deal of care of them, and gave them sweet fresh grass to eat,
and clear water to drink; and if they were sick he was very good to
them; and when they climbed up a steep hill, and the lambs were tired,
he used to carry them in his arms; and when they were all eating their
suppers in the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_235" id="Page_235">[Pg 235]</a></span> field, he used to sit upon a stile, and play them a
tune, and sing to them. And so they were the happiest sheep and lambs in
the whole world. But every night this shepherd used to pen them up in a
fold. Do you know what a sheepfold is? Well, I will tell you. It is a
place like the court; but instead of pales there are hurdles, which<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_236" id="Page_236">[Pg 236]</a></span> are
made of sticks that will bend, such as osier twigs; and they are twisted
and made very fast, so that nothing can creep in, and nothing can get
out. Well, and so every night, when it grew dark and cold, the shepherd
called all his flock, sheep and lambs, together, and drove them into the
fold, and penned them up, and there they lay as snug and warm and
comfortable as could be, and nothing could get in to hurt them, and the
dogs lay round on the outside to guard them, and to bark if any body
came near; and in the morning the shepherd unpenned the fold, and let
them all out again.</p>

</div>

<p>Now they were all very happy, as I told you, and loved the shepherd
dearly that was so good to them&mdash;all except one foolish little lamb. And
this lamb did not like to be shut up every night in the fold; and she<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_237" id="Page_237">[Pg 237]</a></span>
came to her mother, who was a wise old sheep, and said to her, &ldquo;I wonder
why we are shut up so every night? the dogs are not shut up, and why
should we be shut up? I think it is very hard, and I will get away if I
can, I am resolved; for I like to run about where I please, and I think
it is very pleasant in the woods by moonlight.&rdquo; Then the old sheep
said to her, &ldquo;You are very silly, you little lamb, you had better stay
in the fold. The shepherd is so good to us, that we should always do as
he bids us; and if you wander about by yourself, I dare say you will
come to some harm.&rdquo; &ldquo;I dare say not,&rdquo; said the little lamb. And so when
the evening came, and the shepherd called them all to come into the
fold, she would not come, but crept slily under a hedge and hid herself;
and when the rest of the lambs were all in the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_238" id="Page_238">[Pg 238]</a></span> fold and fast asleep,
she came out, and jumped, and frisked, and danced about; and she got out
of the field, and got into a forest full of trees, and a very fierce
wolf came rushing out of a cave and howled very loud. Then the silly
lamb wished she had been shut up in the fold, but the fold was a great
way off. And the wolf saw her and seized her, and carried her away<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_239" id="Page_239">[Pg 239]</a></span> to a
dismal den; and there the wolf had two cubs, and the wolf said to them,
&ldquo;Here, I have brought you a young fat lamb.&rdquo; And so the cubs took her,
and growled over her a little while, and then ate her up.</p>

</div>

<p>Harry said that was a very naughty lamb.</p>

<p>It now began to be quite dark, so Harry and I returned home. Then we had
a long talk about what we had seen during the day; and then Harry had
his bread and milk for supper, and then he said his prayers and went to
bed.</p>

Section 1.  General Terms of Use and Redistributing Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works

1.A.  By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement.  If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or destroy

1.B.  "Project Gutenberg" is a registered trademark.  It may only be

individual work is in the public domain in the United States and you are
located in the United States, we do not claim a right to prevent you from
copying, distributing, performing, displaying or creating derivative
works based on the work as long as all references to Project Gutenberg
are removed.  Of course, we hope that you will support the Project
Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting free access to electronic works by
freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm works in compliance with the terms of
this agreement for keeping the Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with
the work.  You can easily comply with the terms of this agreement by
keeping this work in the same format with its attached full Project
Gutenberg-tm License when you share it without charge with others.

1.D.  The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work.  Copyright laws in most countries are in
a constant state of change.  If you are outside the United States, check
the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this agreement
before downloading, copying, displaying, performing, distributing or
creating derivative works based on this work or any other Project
Gutenberg-tm work.  The Foundation makes no representations concerning
the copyright status of any work in any country outside the United
States.

1.E.  Unless you have removed all references to Project Gutenberg:

1.E.1.  The following sentence, with active links to, or other immediate
access to, the full Project Gutenberg-tm License must appear prominently

Gutenberg" is associated) is accessed, displayed, performed, viewed,
copied or distributed:

posted with permission of the copyright holder), the work can be copied
and distributed to anyone in the United States without paying any fees
or charges.  If you are redistributing or providing access to a work
with the phrase "Project Gutenberg" associated with or appearing on the

1.E.9.

1.E.3.  If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is posted

     the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation."

- You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies
     you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
     does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
     License.  You must require such a user to return or
     destroy all copies of the works possessed in a physical medium
     and discontinue all use of and all access to other copies of
     Project Gutenberg-tm works.

1.F.

1.F.1.  Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
public domain works in creating the Project Gutenberg-tm
collection.  Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may contain
"Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a
computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by
your equipment.

1.F.2.  LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees.  YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH F3.  YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3.  LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from.  If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium with
your written explanation.  The person or entity that provided you with
the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in lieu of a
refund.  If you received the work electronically, the person or entity
providing it to you may choose to give you a second opportunity to
receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund.  If the second copy
is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing without further
opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4.  Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS' WITH NO OTHER
WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO
WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTIBILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PURPOSE.

1.F.5.  Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of damages.
If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement violates the
law of the state applicable to this agreement, the agreement shall be
interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or limitation permitted by
the applicable state law.  The invalidity or unenforceability of any
provision of this agreement shall not void the remaining provisions.

1.F.6.  INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in accordance
with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the production,
promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works,
harmless from all liability, costs and expenses, including legal fees,
that arise directly or indirectly from any of the following which you do
or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this or any Project Gutenberg-tm
work, (b) alteration, modification, or additions or deletions to any
Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any Defect you cause.


Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need, is critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.
To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation
and how your efforts and donations can help, see Sections 3 and 4
and the Foundation web page at http://www.pglaf.org.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://pglaf.org

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including including checks, online payments and credit card
donations.  To donate, please visit: http://pglaf.org/donate


Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.


Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.


Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     http://www.gutenberg.net

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
